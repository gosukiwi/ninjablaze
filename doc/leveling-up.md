# Leveling Up
Once a game finishes, the player is redirected, the output saved and adds
experience to her account. Winning grants double the experience losing does.

Level | Experience Needed | Experience per win

2     | 4                 | 4.9
3     | 9                 | 6
4     | 16                | 7
n     | n * n             | sqrt(n) * 3.5
