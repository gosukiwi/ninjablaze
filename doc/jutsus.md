# Jutsus
Jutsus require abilities and levels in order to be learnt, jutsus have "PP"
which is the ammount of times you can use a jutsu in a fight, they are reloaded
after each fight. 

# Elements
The idea is that elements have strengths and weaknesses.

 * Fire: Offensive
 * Earth: Defensive
 * Lightning: Offensive
 * Water: Defensive
 * Wind: Mixed

# Counters
Some jutsus can only work against another jutsu, they are counters, for example,
a substitution jutsu is a basic counter for any attack, while water prison is a
counter for short-ranged jutsus.

# Buffs
Some jutsus give you buffs, more AGI, STR, INT or just plain damage.

# States
Some jutsus alter state, namely poison and trapped. Other jutsus only work when
the enemy is poisoned or trapped.
